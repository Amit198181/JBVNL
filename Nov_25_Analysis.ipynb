This function will aggressively remove 'Unnamed' parts, clean up newlines and extra spaces, and ensure all column names are human-readable and unique.

I will apply a revised function with a more aggressive `clean_column_name_part` to remove 'Unnamed' patterns and other artifacts, and a `flatten_and_clean_multiindex_columns_v2` function to ensure concise and readable column names. This function will specifically iterate through the multi-index levels, clean each part, and then join the meaningful parts. Columns that remain empty after cleaning will be assigned generic 'Column_X' names, and all column names will be made unique.\n",

To correctly consolidate all available daily reports, I will implement a more robust file search logic. This new logic will list all '.xlsx' files within each daily folder, filter for files starting with 'All' or 'ALL' (case-insensitive), and then prioritize files that explicitly match the current day's date patterns (DD-MM-YY, DD-YY, DD_YY). If no direct date match is found for the current day, it will fall back to selecting 'ALL.xlsx' or the first available 'ALL' related Excel file in the folder. This ensures that even misdated or generically named 'ALL' reports are captured and processed, with the correct 'Report Date' attributed from the folder name.\n",

        "The previous attempt to consolidate daily reports still missed several files due to varied and inconsistent naming conventions. To ensure all available reports are processed, I will enhance the file search logic within the consolidation loop. This involves creating a more comprehensive list of `possible_file_name_patterns_lowercase` that covers various date formats (DD-MM-YYYY, DD-MM-YY) and separators (hyphens, underscores) within the filenames, as well as generic 'all.xlsx' and 'all.xls' files. The revised logic will prioritize exact date matches for the current day's folder, fall back to generic 'all' files, and finally use the first available 'all' related file in the folder if no specific date match is found. This strategy aims to maximize the successful processing of all daily reports.\n",

        "## Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q&A\n",
        "Yes, the analysis successfully summarized key findings from the available November 2025 daily reports and identified significant trends through visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   **Report Structure and Data Complexity**: Daily reports were found in Excel format (e.g., `ALL.xlsx`, `All_DD-MM-YY.xlsx`), featuring complex multi-level headers. The actual column headers were consistently located across rows 10 and 11 (0-indexed) within the Excel files.\n",
        "*   **Robust Data Consolidation**: Due to inconsistent file naming conventions (e.g., `ALL.xlsx`, `All_DD-MM-YY.xlsx`, `ALL_DD-YY.xlsx`, `ALL_DD_YY.xlsx`, `ALL_DD_YY.xlsx`, `ALL-DD-YY.xlsx`, `All-DD-MM-YYYY.xlsx`), an iterative and comprehensive file search strategy was implemented. This allowed for the successful consolidation of 25 out of 30 daily reports into a single `df_consolidated` DataFrame.\n",
        "*   **Effective Column Cleaning**: Custom functions were developed to flatten and clean the multi-level Excel headers, removing 'Unnamed' references, newlines, and extra spaces, resulting in clear, single-level column names for analysis. An extraneous 'Column_0' was dropped, and a 'Report Date' column was added for time-series context.\n",
        "*   **Data Cleaning and Type Conversion**:\n",
        "    *   Out of 198 initial columns, 27 columns with 100% missing values were dropped.\n",
        "    *   Numerous 'object' type columns were successfully converted to numeric (`float64`) where appropriate, enhancing data usability for calculations.\n",
        "    *   55 summary/invalid rows (identified by 'Total' or missing values in 'Sl.No') were removed, resulting in a cleaned DataFrame with 6706 entries and 171 columns.\n",
        "*   **Key Daily Metrics**: Three core metrics were successfully aggregated by 'Report Date': 'Total Effective Consumers', 'Total Billing (Lacs)', and 'Total Collections (Lacs)'. This aggregation resulted in a `df_daily_metrics` DataFrame with 25 entries, representing the available daily reports.\n",
        "*   **Visualized Trends**: Line plots effectively visualized the daily trends for 'Total Effective Consumers', 'Total Billing (Lacs)', and 'Total Collections (Lacs)' throughout November 2025, providing a clear graphical representation of their fluctuations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   Further investigation is required for the missing five daily reports to understand if they exist under different naming conventions or are genuinely absent. Filling these gaps would provide a complete monthly trend for more accurate analysis.\n",
        "*   The consolidated and cleaned `df_consolidated` DataFrame is now prepared for deeper analytical tasks, including identifying specific regions or consumer types driving billing/collection trends, performing comparative analysis across different metrics, or developing predictive models for consumer behavior or revenue.\n"

        "\n",
        "**Summary of Key Findings and Trends:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis provides a clear overview of operational metrics across seven Circles. Key observations include:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Effective Consumers:** RANCHI leads significantly with 1.05 million effective consumers, followed by JAMSHEDPUR (0.75 million) and DHANBAD (0.64 million). DUMKA has the fewest consumers at 0.35 million.\n",
        "*   **Billing Percentage:** JAMSHEDPUR and RANCHI show strong billing percentages, with 91.24% and 90.76% respectively, indicating efficient billing. DUMKA has the lowest billing percentage at 78.58%, suggesting potential issues in billing accuracy or process.\n",
        "*   **Unit Sold (MU):** RANCHI (212.92 MU) and JAMSHEDPUR (152.02 MU) are the highest in terms of units sold, aligning with their higher consumer bases. DUMKA (75.48 MU) and GIRIDIH (77.89 MU) have the lowest unit sales.\n",
        "*   **Financial Metrics (Assessment, Subsidy, Collection in Crores):**\n",
        "    *   **Assessment (Without Subsidy):** RANCHI (153.94 Cr) and JAMSHEDPUR (106.33 Cr) have the highest assessments, reflecting their larger consumer base and unit sales.\n",
        "    *   **Subsidy:** RANCHI receives the highest subsidy at 43.14 Cr, followed by JAMSHEDPUR (29.23 Cr) and DHANBAD (26.96 Cr). MEDININAGAR and DUMKA receive comparatively lower subsidies.\n",
        "    *   **Total Assessment (With Subsidy):** RANCHI (110.80 Cr) and JAMSHEDPUR (77.10 Cr) maintain the highest net assessment after subsidy.\n",
        "    *   **Collection:** RANCHI (115.15 Cr) and JAMSHEDPUR (79.08 Cr) also lead in collections. MEDININAGAR (20.08 Cr) and DUMKA (19.98 Cr) have the lowest collections.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Notable Differences and Trends:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **RANCHI and JAMSHEDPUR** consistently outperform other Circles across all key metrics (effective consumers, billing percentage, unit sold, assessment, and collection), indicating them as the largest and potentially most efficient operational areas.\n",
        "*   **DUMKA** consistently lags behind, showing the lowest numbers in effective consumers, unit sold, and collections, and also the lowest billing percentage. This suggests a need for focused intervention in this Circle.\n",
        "*   **DHANBAD** ranks third in most volume-based metrics (consumers, assessment, subsidy), but its billing percentage (85.29%) is notably lower than RANCHI and JAMSHEDPUR.\n",
        "*   The relationship between Assessment Without Subsidy and Collection is crucial. While RANCHI has the highest assessment without subsidy (153.94 Cr), its collection is 115.15 Cr, implying a collection efficiency that warrants further investigation. Similarly, the other Circles also show varying collection efficiencies relative to their assessments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The `df_consolidated` DataFrame was successfully filtered for seven specified Circles, resulting in a `df_filtered` DataFrame of shape (3776, 171).\n",
        "*   The 'Billing Status - Billing' column was successfully converted to a numeric (`float64`) type after cleaning, which involved removing '%' symbols and handling non-numeric entries by coercing them to `NaN`.\n",
        "*   A `metric_column_map` was effectively used to define aggregation types (sum for counts/amounts, mean for percentages) and unit conversions (e.g., 'Unit Sold' to Million Units, monetary values to Crores).\n",
        "*   The final `df_circle_summary` DataFrame provides an aggregated view of 7 key metrics for each of the 7 Circles.\n",
        "*   **RANCHI** is the largest Circle with 1.05 million effective consumers, 212.92 MU of units sold, and the highest collection of 115.15 Cr. It also has a strong billing percentage of 90.76%.\n",
        "*   **JAMSHEDPUR** closely follows RANCHI in size and efficiency, with 0.75 million effective consumers, 152.02 MU units sold, 79.08 Cr in collection, and the highest billing percentage at 91.24%.\n",
        "*   **DUMKA** consistently performs at the lower end across all metrics, with 0.35 million effective consumers, 75.48 MU units sold, 19.98 Cr in collection, and the lowest billing percentage of 78.58%.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   **Investigate DUMKA Circle Performance:** Given DUMKA's consistently low performance across all metrics, especially its low billing percentage, a deeper dive into its operational challenges, consumer engagement strategies, and infrastructure is warranted.\n",
        "*   **Analyze Collection Efficiency:** While RANCHI and JAMSHEDPUR lead in total collections, a comparative analysis of actual collections against total assessments (with and without subsidy) for each Circle would provide insights into collection efficiency and potential revenue leakages or opportunities for improvement.\n"

'EFFECTIVE CONSUMERS (Nos)' will map to 'Effective Consumer - Total Effective Consumers', 'BILLED_CONSUMER (Nos)' will also use this as a proxy due to lack of a distinct daily billed consumer count, 'BILLING %' will map to 'Billing Status - Billing', and 'UNIT SOLD/BILLED (MU)' to 'Billing Status - Unit Sold'.

        "\n",
        "The analysis provides a clear overview of operational metrics across fifteen Circles. Key observations include:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Effective Consumers:** RANCHI leads significantly with ~15.76 million effective consumers, followed by DEOGHAR (~9.49 million) and HAZARIBAGH (~9.23 million). KODERMA has the fewest consumers at ~2.28 million.\n",
        "*   **Billing Percentage:** DHANBAD and RANCHI show strong billing percentages, with 43.61% and 44.98% respectively, indicating efficient billing. HAZARIBAGH and RAMGARH have the lowest billing percentages at 14.50% and 15.32%, suggesting potential issues in billing accuracy or process.\n",
        "*   **Unit Sold (MU):** RANCHI (~2056 MU) and JAMSHEDPUR (~1129 MU) are the highest in terms of units sold, aligning with their higher consumer bases. KODERMA (~87 MU) and GUMLA (~203 MU) have the lowest unit sales.\n",
        "*   **Financial Metrics (Assessment, Subsidy, Collection in Crores):**\n",
        "    *   **Assessment (Without Subsidy):** RANCHI (~1699 Cr) and JAMSHEDPUR (~908 Cr) have the highest assessments, reflecting their larger consumer base and unit sales.\n",
        "    *   **Subsidy:** RANCHI receives the highest subsidy at ~671 Cr, followed by HAZARIBAGH (~311 Cr) and DALTONGANJ (~329 Cr).\n",
        "    *   **Total Assessment (With Subsidy):** RANCHI (~1239 Cr) and JAMSHEDPUR (~786 Cr) maintain the highest net assessment after subsidy.\n",
        "    *   **Collection:** RANCHI (~621 Cr) and JAMSHEDPUR (~510 Cr) also lead in collections. GARHWA (~23 Cr) and KODERMA (~34 Cr) have the lowest collections.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Notable Differences and Trends:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **RANCHI and JAMSHEDPUR** consistently outperform other Circles across most key metrics (effective consumers, unit sold, assessment, and collection), indicating them as the largest and most productive operational areas. RANCHI has the highest effective consumers, unit sold, total assessment with subsidy, and total collection. JAMSHEDPUR is consistently second or third.\n",
        "*   **HAZARIBAGH and RAMGARH** show notably low billing percentages, which could indicate challenges in the billing process despite having a moderate number of effective consumers. Further investigation into their billing operations is warranted.\n",
        "*   **DUMKA, GARHWA, GUMLA, and KODERMA** generally appear to be smaller circles with lower values across most metrics, suggesting they might require different strategic approaches compared to the larger circles.\n",
        "*   There's a significant variability in **Collection Efficiency** (Collections relative to Total Assessment With Subsidy). For instance, CHAIBASA has a high collection of ~514 Cr relative to its total assessment with subsidy of ~670 Cr, indicating good efficiency. In contrast, GARHWA has a total assessment of ~96 Cr but only ~23 Cr in collections, suggesting a lower efficiency that needs to be addressed.\n",

        "*   The `df_consolidated` DataFrame was successfully filtered for fifteen specified Circles, resulting in a `df_filtered` DataFrame of shape (6706, 171).\n",
        "*   The 'Billing Status - Billing' column was successfully converted to a numeric (`float64`) type after cleaning, which involved removing '%' symbols and handling non-numeric entries by coercing them to `NaN`.\n",
        "*   A `metric_column_map` was effectively used to define aggregation types (sum for counts/amounts, mean for percentages) and unit conversions (e.g., 'Unit Sold' to Million Units, monetary values to Crores).\n",

        "*   **Investigate Low Billing Percentage**: Circles with significantly lower billing percentages like HAZARIBAGH and RAMGARH should be further investigated to understand the underlying causes (e.g., meter reading issues, data entry errors, or operational inefficiencies).\n",
        "*   **Optimize Collection Strategies**: Circles with low collection efficiency (e.g., GARHWA, GUMLA, KODERMA relative to their assessments) should be analyzed to identify barriers to collection and develop targeted strategies.\n",
        "*   **Comparative Analysis**: A deeper dive into the per-consumer metrics (e.g., average billing per consumer, average collection per consumer) could provide more granular insights into the performance of each Circle."

        "The `NameError: name 'df_consolidated' is not defined` occurred because the data consolidation loop failed to find any daily report folders, resulting in an empty `daily_dfs` list. This indicates that the necessary daily report files were not present in the `/content/` directory during the last execution, likely due to a Colab environment reset. To fix this, I will re-include the file copy operation from Google Drive to the `/content/` directory at the beginning of the code block to ensure all necessary files are available for processing. Additionally, I will re-enable the informative print statements within the consolidation loop to provide clearer feedback on file processing status.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   **Discrepancy in RANCHI and DHANBAD:** Despite being large circles with high total billing, RANCHI and DHANBAD show relatively low collection efficiency, ranking among the bottom performers. This suggests that while their absolute numbers are high, their processes for converting billing into collections might be inefficient compared to their size.\n",
        "*   **Focus on GARHWA:** GARHWA consistently appears at the bottom for Collection Efficiency and Average Collection per Consumer, indicating a severe issue that requires immediate investigation and intervention.\n",
        "*   **High Efficiency in Smaller Circles:** KODERMA, CHAIBASA, GUMLA, and DUMKA demonstrate strong collection efficiency, which might imply effective local strategies or different consumer demographics. Their practices could potentially be scaled or adapted to other circles.\n",
        "*   **HAZARIBAGH and DALTONGANJ:** These circles are consistently low in Average Collection per Consumer, indicating a need to improve their collection strategies, possibly targeting consumer payment behavior or enhancing collection infrastructure.\n",
        "*   **Further Investigation of KPIs:** The calculated KPIs provide a normalized view of performance, allowing for fairer comparisons across circles of different sizes. Further analysis could involve identifying correlations between these KPIs and other operational factors (e.g., number of field agents, types of consumers, infrastructure quality) to pinpoint root causes of performance variations."
